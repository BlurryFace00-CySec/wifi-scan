# wifi-scan
Wi-Fi router manager app to manage openWRT router.

OpenWRT device:TP-LINK WR902ACV3

This project goals is to:
1. To create a mobile app that can manage an openWRT device, this device will be configured with Wireguard VPN client.
2. To implement a SSH client inside the mobile app as an option to the user.
3. To configure the openWRT device so that it can connect to the public Wi-Fi.

Problems encounter:
1. The device cannot be connected to the low speed wifi/mobile data
2. I did not have much experience in flutter to create an app that can manage the openWRT device, so i did manage to create some interface
but failed to use wifi_scan package or any other package that enables me to communicate to the device

I hope someone who have much higher experience can guide me through this project as it is important for me to learn, this is my first time psoting on gitHub, if i did not have any platform ethics, kindly give me some advice.

Thanks.
